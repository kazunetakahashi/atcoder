# atcoder

I always enjoy solving problems in [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp). This repository contains all solutions I have been made since 2014 in C++.

In this repository, I commit the source codes whenever I try the test cases with my own auto-submitter. The process is completely automatic.

## Note

Here I declare that **I won't push my local commitments to the remote repository during the contest periods**. The commitments containing the solutions are made in the contest time, but they won't be public at least by the time the contest is over.

## Disclaimer

**It is not necessarily true that source codes here are correct.** I usually check sample cases in my local environment and after checking that my solution pass all sample cases submit it to AtCoder, but of course sometimes it results in WA, TLE or something. You can check my result at the contest page in AtCoder.
