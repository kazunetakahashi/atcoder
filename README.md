# atcoder

I always enjoy solving problems in [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp). This repository contains all the solutions I have been making since 2014.

In this repository, I commit the source codes whenever I try the test cases with my own auto-submitter. The process is completely automatic.

## Note

Here I declare that **I won't push my local commitments to the remote repository during the contest periods**. The commitments containing the solutions are made in the contest time, but they won't be public by the time the contest is over.

## Disclaimer

**It is not necessarily true that the source codes here are correct.** I usually try my solution with sample cases in my local environment and after checking that it passes all the sample cases submit it to AtCoder, but of course sometimes it results in WA, TLE or something. You can check my result at each contest page in AtCoder.
